## Problem

Given a sequence of non-negative integers a0,…,an−1, find the maximum pairwise product, that is, the largest integer that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the sequence (or, more formally, max (0≤i≠j≤n−1) aiaj). Different elements here mean ai and aj with i≠j (it can be the case that ai=aj).

## Input format

The first line of the input contains an integer n. The next line contains n non-negative integers a0,…,an−1 (separated by spaces).

## Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅105
0 ≤ a0,…,an−1 ≤ 105

## Output format

Output a single number — the maximum pairwise product.

Sample 1

Input:

line 1 -> 2
line 2 -> 1 2 3

Output: 6

Explanation: 6=2×3
